# Evening-Startpage
A comfy startpage

A fork of SUI and Evening-Startpage

My additions:
 - Weather
 - Descriptions to app links (With URL shown on hover)
 - Use Iconify for icons
 - Store apps, bookmarks and frequent sites in json files (/assets/data)
 - Status indicator next to apps (can be toggled on or off), status is based of an ajax call to the supplied url.

To use:
* Get an API key from openweathermap.
* Open `/assets/js/weather.js`
* Edit your lat, long and locale.
* Replace `<YOURAPIKEY>` with your openweathermap API key

Note:

 - No `,` at the end of the last app's line
 - Find the names  of icons to use at [Material Design Icons](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/?query=sql/)
